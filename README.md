## Hi I'm Jukka or Yucca, Jugi, Yugi,... ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software business generalist with a passion for turning real customer problems into impactful digital solutions. My career has focused on the full product lifecycle â€” not so much on coding, but everything else around it:

- ðŸš€ Problem discovery and validation  
- ðŸ§© Co-creation and MVP development  
- ðŸŽ¯ Product strategy and pricing  
- ðŸ“ˆ Go-to-market and sales enablement  

Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked closely with product teams, customers, designers, and developers to make things happen â€” always starting from the userâ€™s perspective. I passionately love the Problem.

## What makes this moment exciting?

Weâ€™re entering a new era where **AI is radically changing the way software is built**. While Iâ€™m not a traditional developer, Iâ€™ve recently embraced AI-assisted development tools, and coding has become part of my creative toolkit. Itâ€™s incredibly empowering to be able to go from idea to execution faster than ever before.

I believe generalists with strong product intuition, domain understanding, and customer focus will thrive in this AI-native world â€” and Iâ€™m here to explore, build, and learn with others.
